    <h2>Talking with Roomba</h2>
    <p>iRobot, the maker of Roomba, seem to be very open to the idea of
      their products being used for academic or "hacker" projects.&nbsp;
      They provide a serial API, the <a
href="https://www.irobotweb.com/~/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/iRobot_Roomba_600_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf">Open

        Interface</a>, which makes it very easy to control from your own
      microcontroller.&nbsp; And the DIN connector used to interface
      with the Roomba is present on nearly all models.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img src="008_din_connector.jpg" alt=""
        width="671" height="367"><br>
      <h5>The DIN connector spec</h5>
    </div>
    <p>Some key notes about the DIN connector, with respect to
      connecting a Raspberry Pi:<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Vpwr is the Roomba's battery voltage.&nbsp; For my Roomba,
        I measured this at around 13V.&nbsp; The Pi requires either 5V
        or 3.3V power.&nbsp; I decided to power the pi via the micro USB
        port, which wants 5V.&nbsp; To get there, I put a voltage
        regulator in between the Roomba's 13V and the micro USB powering
        the Pi.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you'd rather, you could always power the Pi from an
          external source, such as a USB power bank.&nbsp; Then you
          wouldn't need a voltage regulator or Roomba's power at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The serial (RXD, TXD) logic levels coming out of the Roomba
        are 5V, whereas the Pi's logic level is 3.3V.&nbsp; Now, the
        Pi's 3.3V signals should be readable by the Roomba.&nbsp; But,
        the reverse isn't true -- the Roomba's 5V logic could damage the
        Pi's 3.3V pins.&nbsp; I figured a good way around this would be
        to use a USB-to-TTL adapter which accepts 5V logic levels.<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>It may be possible to only wire up the Pi-to-Roomba serial
          connection (Pi's TX to Roomba's RX), then you probably
          wouldn't need to worry about logic levels, since usually 5V
          logic level circuits will read 3.3V logic levels just
          fine.&nbsp; In this case you wouldn't need the USB-to-TTL
          adapter; just wire directly to the Pi's TX UART pin.&nbsp; I
          haven't test this, however.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have the TX and RX wired up, there are several
      easy-to-use libraries available on github (and probably elsewhere)
      for communicating using the Open Interface.&nbsp; I found a Python
      based library called <a
        href="https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PyRoombaAdapter">PyRoombaAdapter</a>
      which worked out well for me, and so is used in this project.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Remote Power-On</h2>
    <p>One thing I noticed in my initial testing with controlling Roomba
      with the Open Interface is that it's possible for Roomba to be in
      a Power Off state.&nbsp; In this state, it isn't listening on the
      Open Interface and so won't respond to any commands from the
      Pi.&nbsp; It enters this state after a period of time doing
      nothing (probably to save battery life) or it can be manually
      triggered over the Open Interface.&nbsp; (It doesn't appear to
      enter this state while sitting at its charging dock,
      however.)&nbsp; The only way to power Roomba back on is to press
      its "Clean" button.</p>
    <p>For my project, I wanted to be able to fully control Roomba,
      including power on.&nbsp; So, I added some extra wiring to trigger
      the "Clean" button push.&nbsp; After i pulled off my Roomba'
      cover, I noted that the button in question, marked "SW5",
      functioned by momentarily connecting the contact points on either
      side.&nbsp; One side is battery voltage (13V) and the other side
      is usually ground.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img src="002_roomba_button.jpg" alt=""
        width="960" height="540"><br>
      <h5>Roomba under the hood</h5>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Fortunately, I found that the SW5 button will
        trigger even if momentarily hit with a voltage much smaller than
        13V -- in fact 3.3V from one of the Pi's GPIO pins will
        work.&nbsp; So, I soldered a wire from the SW5 button to a
        JST-PH female connector which I hot-glued just above the DIN
        connector.&nbsp; (It would have been much slicker to utilize one
        of the other port on the DIN connector for this - for instance,
        there are two power outs and two grounds, where you only really
        need one of each.&nbsp; But this would require desoldering the
        DIN connector from the Roomba board ... I didn't have a spare
        and was concerned about screwing it up, so did it with a new
        connector all together.)<br>

      <h5>Roomba "Clean" button trigger wire<br>
      </h5>
      <div align="left">Before putting Roomba' cover back on, I cut out
        a hole for the connectors.&nbsp; I drilled a 1/2" hole for the
        DIN connector, then carved out a hole for the JST-PH with a
        Dremel.<br>
        <br>
        <div align="center"><img src="007_hole_in_cover.jpg" alt=""

          <h5>Hole in Roomba cover<br>
          </h5>
          <div align="left">The only other Roomba modification I made
            was to add a strip of velcro to attach the Pi.&nbsp; The
            modifications I did don't prevent Roomba from being used
            normally.<br>
          </div>
          <div align="left"><br>

                width="960" height="540"><br>
              <h5>Wiring closeup</h5>
              <p align="left">The only other thing to note is the extra,
                short green wire I added to the unused port of the
                JST-PH connector.&nbsp; I added this just to help when
                pushing it in and pulling it out.&nbsp; It's kind of far
                down there!<br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <h2 align="left">Pi Connections</h2>
              <p align="left">Connecting to the Pi is fairly
                straightforward.&nbsp; <br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">Power the pi via the Micro USB cable
                (which you'll need to attach to the 5V output and ground
                of the 5V voltage regulator).&nbsp; <br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">Plug in the USB-to-TTL adapter to the Pi's
                USB port.&nbsp; My USB-to-TTL adapter had a jumper to
                select either 3.3V or 5V logic; set it to 5V.&nbsp; Make
                sure you connect the adapter's RX to Roomba's TX, and
                adapter's TX to Roomba's RX.<br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">For the "Clean" button trigger, connect to
                a GPIO pin which is normally low.&nbsp; I believe you
                can set this up for any GPIO pin, but I just checked one
                that was already low by default, GPIO 18.&nbsp; The
                software will momentarily set this pin high (3.3V) and
                then low again, which triggers a button push response
                from Roomba.<br>

        pistreaming's http server and websocket server (8082 and 8084 in
        the default code).&nbsp; Now you have a Roomba equipped with
        streaming video which you can control over the internet!&nbsp;

    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>After further testing, it seems that even while docked, it is
      possible for the Pi to completely drain Roomba's battery.&nbsp;
      Since my initial goal was to leave the Pi always on (and kick off
      pistreaming_roomba as desired to get a mobile security cam), this
      isn't such a good finding.&nbsp; I suspect the Roomba stops
      charging once it reaches full battery voltage, and thereafter
      doesn't check if it needs to start charging again.&nbsp;
      Meanwhile, a connected Pi drains the battery...&nbsp; If you want
      to keep the Pi on for long periods of time, it might be necessary
      to periodically turn on Roomba and do whatever action is needed to
      trigger a restart to the charging cycle.<br>
